Rain Prediction Using ANN

🚀 Excited to share my latest project: Rain Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)! 🌧️

In this project, I built an ANN model to predict whether it will rain the next day using 10 years of daily weather data from various Australian locations. From handling missing values and outliers to scaling, encoding, and feature engineering, every step was crucial in preparing the data for modeling.

* Key Highlights:
  
🔍 Data Preprocessing:
 - Cleaned and transformed data with 23 attributes.
 - Addressed missing values using mode/median strategies.
 - Engineered cyclic features for date columns.
   
📊 Visualization:
 - Explored data patterns using heatmaps, scatter plots, and line charts.
 - Analyzed year-wise rainfall and wind speeds.

🧠 Model Building:
 - Designed a deep learning model with multiple layers using Keras and
 TensorFlow.
 - Implemented Dropout and Batch Normalization to optimize performance
 and reduce overfitting.
 - Achieved 85% accuracy during training!
 
🎯Tools & Techniques:
 - Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Keras, 
 alongside machine learning preprocessing techniques.
